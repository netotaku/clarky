<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<section class="section typography">  
    <p>This site uses minimal, privacy-respecting tracking to better understand how visitors interact with the content â€” without compromising your personal data or attention.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Analytics</h2>

    <p>
    We use <a href="https://counter.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counter.dev</a>, a privacy-focused analytics platform that:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Does not use cookies</li>
    <li>Does not track personal identifiers (like IP address or browser fingerprint)</li>
    <li>Does not store any personal information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    This approach allows us to get a basic sense of traffic (like which pages are most visited) while respecting your privacy completely â€” in line with GDPR and similar regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Control</h2>

    <p>
    Since we don't use cookies or collect personal data, thereâ€™s nothing you need to accept or opt into. You can browse freely, knowing that your visit is not tracked in a way that identifies you.
    </p>

    <p>By continuing to use this site, you agree to this lightweight, ethical approach to understanding audience interest â€” without surveillance.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you</strong> for visiting and supporting a more humane, transparent web. ðŸ–¤</p>
