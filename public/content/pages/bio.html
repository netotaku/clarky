<h1>Night of the Vampire</h1>

    <p>
    I’m <strong>Night of the Vampire</strong>, a producer and DJ based in Bristol, UK. My music has been described as <em>vibey</em> and <em>nostalgic</em> — drawing influence from early ’90s Rave, UK Bleep, Ambient, and Jungle.

    Before this, Night of the Vampire was a metal band doing unexpected pop covers — loud, weird, and fun. But when the pandemic shut everything down, I shifted focus and migrated fully into electronic production.

    Everything I make now comes through a sampler on my phone — lo-fi tech, hi-fi intent. I create purely for the love of it, though a few of my tracks have found homes on independent labels.

    I DJ when I can, share mixes online, and keep it all rooted in the joy of discovery and memory. This site is a collection of that energy.
